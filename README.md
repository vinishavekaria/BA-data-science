# British Airways Data Science Simulation

This repository showcases work completed as part of the **British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Program** (via Forage). The project demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied in a real-world airline context to extract insights and support business decisions.

## Project Overview

During this simulation, I worked on airline-related datasets to explore customer behavior, analyze trends, and build predictive models. Key tasks included:

- Collecting and cleaning customer feedback data to prepare it for analysis.  
- Exploring patterns in booking behavior and customer preferences using Python.  
- Building models to identify factors influencing customer decisions.  
- Creating visualizations to communicate insights clearly and effectively.  
- Translating findings into actionable recommendations for airline operations.

## Skills and Techniques Demonstrated

- **Python for Data Analysis:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Data Collection:** Web scraping and data cleaning  
- **Predictive Analytics:** Building models to identify key drivers of customer behavior  
- **Data Visualization:** Turning raw data into clear, interpretable charts and graphs  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying methods to support data-driven insights  
- **Communication:** Presenting findings in a way that informs business decisions  

## Example Analyses

- Customer review trends and sentiment insights  
- Factors impacting booking patterns  
- Visual summaries of airline performance metrics  
- Predictive models to inform marketing or operational strategies
